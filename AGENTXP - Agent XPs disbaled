Context
Agent XPs allows the specific extended stored procedure that is used by SQL Server Agent services, to create maintenance plans and SQL jobs.

Two possible values of the Agent XPs configuration parameter are as following:

Zero (0): Agent XPs are disabled
One (1): Agent XPs is enabled

When this option is not enabled, the SQL Server Agent node is not available in SQL Server Management Studio Object Explorer.

To check the value:

use master
go
select * from sys.configurations where name='Agent XPs'
Update to Customer
After our recent Exxon check we have noticed that the agent XPs option is disabled on the following instances:
<instance>, <instance>...

This means that the SQL Server Agent node is not available in SSMS. We'll enable this by <date about a week away> in order to help us more efficiently manage your estate.
This change will require no downtime.

Please let us know if you wish us to cancel this work.

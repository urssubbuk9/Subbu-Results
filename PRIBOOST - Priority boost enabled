Context
Priority boost is a "to be run only if Microsoft tells you to" setting that causes the SQL Server process to run as a high-priority process in Windows. This can cause all sorts of issues including, ironically, worse performance of SQL Server as it starves other processes on the server, including the OS itself.

MS warns against using this especially if the instance is in a windows failover cluster.

Initial email
While performing our recent Exxon checks, we identified that the following instances of SQL Server are running with "priority boost" enabled.

<<list of instances>>

This is a configuration setting that should only be used under exceptional circumstances, such as if Microsoft is requesting it while troubleshooting an issue.

We strongly recommend turning this off, as the side-effects of this can include server instability and crashes.

Unless we hear otherwise, we will make this change on <<date/time>>; however, it won't take effect until the SQL Server instance is restarted (eg for patching).

If you have any concerns or queries, or can tell us why this was set, please get in touch.

Follow-up
This is an advanced option, so...:

-- if advanced options are not enabled:
exec sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
reconfigure;
-- do the fix
exec sp_configure 'priority boost', 0;
reconfigure;
-- if advanced options was already on, ignore this bit:
exec sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
reconfigure;
